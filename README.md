# 🛠 Data Science Toolkit  
This repository serves as a **collection of data science techniques and algorithms**, demonstrated through **short, practical projects**. Each notebook provides a **clear explanation, use case, and implementation**.

## 📌 Structure  
The repository is divided into sections based on **machine learning categories**:

- **Supervised Learning**  
  - 📌 Classification (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)  
  - 📌 Regression (e.g., Linear Regression, XGBoost)  

- **Unsupervised Learning**  
  - 📌 Clustering (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN)  
  - 📌 Anomaly Detection (e.g., Isolation Forest, LOF)  

- **Feature Engineering**  
  - 📌 Handling Missing Values  
  - 📌 Dimensionality Reduction (e.g., PCA)  

- **Model Evaluation**  
  - 📌 Classification Metrics (ROC AUC, Precision-Recall)  
  - 📌 Regression Metrics (R², RMSE)  

## 📍 Example: Isolation Forest for Anomaly Detection  
[🔗 Click here to see the notebook](unsupervised/anomaly-detection/isolation-forest.ipynb)  

This notebook demonstrates **how to detect anomalies using Isolation Forest**, covering:  
✔ Understanding the algorithm  
✔ Applying it to a real dataset  
✔ Visualizing outliers
